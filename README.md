# Data Analysis with Python (Web Demo)

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization concepts inspired by Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, implemented in a modern, emerald-themed web page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No terminal or installation required—just open the HTML file in your browser.

## Features
- **Data cleaning and manipulation**: Simulated with JavaScript arrays and table rendering, inspired by Pandas DataFrames.
- **Interactive charts**: Visualizations created with Chart.js, inspired by Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Modular and interactive sections**: Each project is self-contained and interactive, simulating Python data analysis workflows in the browser.

## Included Projects
- **COVID-19 Analysis**: View example infection and mortality curves from a sample dataset.
- **Movie Data Analysis (IMDb/TMDB)**: Explore genres, ratings, and trends from a sample movie dataset.
- **Consumer Habits Study**: Visualize and analyze simulated consumer habit statistics.

## How to use this project?
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `data_analysis_index.html` in your browser.
3. Click the buttons in each section to load and explore the example datasets and charts—no setup or terminal needed.

## File Structure
- `data_analysis_index.html`: Main HTML file with the interface.
- `data_analysis_styles.css`: Modern emerald styles for a clean look.
- `data_analysis_app.js`: All interactive logic and visualization code.

## Customization
You can easily add more datasets, change styles, or expand the logic by editing the JavaScript and CSS files. You can also replace the example data with your own CSV or JSON data for more advanced analysis.
